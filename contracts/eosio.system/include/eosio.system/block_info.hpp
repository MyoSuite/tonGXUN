/**
 * Get information on the latest block batch.
 *
 * A block batch is a contiguous range of blocks of a particular size.
 * A sequence of blocks can be partitioned into a sequence of block batches, where all except for perhaps the last batch
 * in the sequence have the same size. The last batch in the sequence can have a smaller size if the
 * blocks of the blockchain that would complete that batch have not yet been generated or recorded.
 *
 * This function enables the caller to specify a particular partitioning of the sequence of blocks into a sequence of
 * block batches of a particular non-zero size (`batch_size`) and then isolates the last block batch in that sequence
 * and returns the information about that latest block batch if possible. The partitioning will ensure that
 * `batch_start_height_offset` will be equal to the starting block height of exactly one of block batches in the
 * sequence.
 *
 * The information about the latest block batch is the same data captured in `block_batch_info`.
 * Particularly, it returns the height and timestamp of starting and ending blocks within that latest block batch.
 * Note that the range spanning from the start to end block of the latest block batch may be less than batch_size
 * because latest block batch may be incomplete.
 * Also, it is possible for the record capturing info for the starting block to not exist in the blockinfo table. This
 * can either be due to the records being erased as they fall out of the rolling window or, in rare cases, due to gaps
 * in block info records due to failures of the onblock action. In such a case, this function will be unable to return a
 * `block_batch_info` and will instead be forced to return the `insufficient_data` error code.
 * Furthermore, if `batch_start_height_offset` is greater than the height of the latest block for which
 * information is recorded in the blockinfo table, there will be no latest block batch identified for the function to
 * return information about and so it will again be forced to return the `insufficient_data` error code instead.
