## System Resources

Antelope-based blockchains work with three system resources:

* [RAM](02_ram.md)
* [CPU](03_cpu.md)
* [NET](04_net.md)

## How To Allocate System Resources

Antelope-based blockchain accounts need sufficient system resources, RAM, CPU and NET, to interact with the smart contracts deployed on the blockchain.

### Stake NET and CPU

The CPU and NET system resources are allocated by the account owner via the staking mechanism. Refer to the [cleos manual](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/blob/main/docs/02_cleos/02_how-to-guides/how-to-stake-resource.md) on how to do it via the command line interface.

You will also find that staking/unstaking is at times referred to as delegating/undelegating. The economics of staki
